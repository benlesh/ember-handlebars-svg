ember-handlebars-svg
====================

A set of patches to get Ember-Handlebars to work properly with SVG

## Requirements

This will only work with the latest Canary version of Ember.js, as it relies on the exposure of Metamorph's `wrapMap` via `Ember._metamorphWrapMap`.

## Additional JQuery Support

This bower package includes a directory called `jquery-svg/` under which you'll find files for adding SVG support to JQuery.

## Bower

This is available via bower:

```sh
bower install ember-handlebars-svg
```

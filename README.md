ember-handlebars-svg
====================

A set of patches to get Ember-Handlebars to work properly with SVG

## Alpha 

This will only work with the latest Canary version of Ember.js, as it relies on the exposure of Metamorph's `wrapMap` via `Ember._metamorphWrapMap`.


## Bower

This is available via bower:

```sh
bower install ember-handlebars-svg
```
